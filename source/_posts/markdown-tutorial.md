  [org-mode: 最好的文档编辑利器，没有之一](https://www.cnblogs.com/holbrook/archive/2012/04/12/2444992.html)

  > 尽管按照org-mode 官方 的说法，Org 是一个基于快速高效的文本方式来实现做笔记、管理待办事项（TODO list）以及做项目计划的模式（Org is a mode for keeping notes, maintaining TODO lists, and doing project planning with a fast and effective plain-text system ），但 Org-mode 首先是最好的文档编辑利器，没有之一。

    The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

    Beautiful is better than ugly.
    Explicit is better than implicit.
    Simple is better than complex.
    Complex is better than complicated.
    Flat is better than nested.
    Sparse is better than dense.
    Readability counts.
    Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
    Although practicality beats purity.
    Errors should never pass silently.
    Unless explicitly silenced.
    In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
    There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
    Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
    Now is better than never.
    Although never is often better than *right* now.
    If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
    If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
    Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
